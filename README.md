# Path-visualizer
<p>This is a path-finding algorithm visualizer built using ReactJS</p>
<p>The start node is colored in green and the end node in purple. You can drag them around anywhere on the grid.</p>
<p>In order to make walls, press the mouse down inside a node that is neither start nor end node, now move the mouse around which converts the normal nodes into walls and vice-versa.</p>
<p>You can choose algorithms from the 'Algorithms' dropdown (Curently there are only 2 options) and the hit then 'visualize' button. Once the algorithm is done executing you can drag the start/end around to see the nodes update in realtime.</p>
<p>There are features like prebuilt mazes, setting speed, you clear the path by clicking 'clear path' button and if you want to clear the walls as well hit the 'clear board' button. When the algorithm is running you cant access any dropdowns or buttons.</p>
<p>Note: Once the algorithm is done executing you can't make new walls, to do that you would have to click 'clear path'. Also make sure to reload if something unexpected happens.</p>
